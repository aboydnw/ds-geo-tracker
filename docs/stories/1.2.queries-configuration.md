# Story 1.2: GEO Queries Configuration

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** product manager,
**I want** a configurable list of GEO queries to track,
**so that** I can easily add, remove, or modify queries without code changes.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. `src/queries.js` exports an array of query objects as default export
2. Each query object has: `id` (string), `name` (string), `searchTerms` (array of strings), `category` (string)
3. Default queries include: VEDA Dashboard, titiler, STAC, COG, Satellite Imagery, Climate Data, Development Seed
4. File is well-documented with JSDoc comments explaining the structure
5. Queries can be imported and iterated in main script
6. `searchTerms` are documented as metadata in MVP — they are included in Plausible event props for reference, and become actively queried in Epic 3 when data source integrations (e.g., Google Trends) use them to fetch real search volume data

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Create `src/` directory structure (AC: 1)
- [x] Create `src/queries.js` file (AC: 1)
- [x] Define query object schema with JSDoc (AC: 2, 4)
  - [x] Document `id` field
  - [x] Document `name` field
  - [x] Document `searchTerms` field — note MVP vs. Epic 3 usage
  - [x] Document `category` field
- [x] Add default GEO queries (AC: 3)
  - [x] VEDA Dashboard (category: product)
  - [x] titiler (category: product)
  - [x] STAC (category: technology)
  - [x] Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF (category: technology)
  - [x] Satellite Imagery (category: trend)
  - [x] Climate Data (category: trend)
  - [x] Development Seed (category: organization)
- [x] Export queries as ES module default export (AC: 1, 5)
- [x] Test import in index.js (AC: 5)

## Dev Notes
**Query Schema:**
```javascript
/**
 * @typedef {Object} GeoQuery
 * @property {string} id - Unique identifier (kebab-case)
 * @property {string} name - Display name for the query
 * @property {string[]} searchTerms - Related search terms (metadata in MVP; queried in Epic 3)
 * @property {string} category - Query category (product|technology|trend|organization)
 */
```

**Categories:**
- `product` - Development Seed products and tools
- `technology` - Geospatial technologies and standards
- `trend` - Industry trends and use cases
- `organization` - Organization/brand mentions

**searchTerms in MVP vs. Epic 3:**
In the MVP, `searchTerms` are included in event props as a comma-separated string for reference. They are not actively queried against any external API. In Epic 3 (Story 3.1), Google Trends integration will iterate over `searchTerms` to fetch actual search volume data for each term.

**File Location:** `src/queries.js`

### Testing
- Import file in Node.js REPL: `import queries from './src/queries.js'`
- Verify `queries` is an array
- Verify each query has all required fields
- Verify at least 7 default queries exist

## Change Log
| Date | Version | Description | Author |
|------|---------|-------------|--------|
| 2026-02-05 | 0.1 | Initial story created | PO Agent |
| 2026-02-05 | 0.2 | Clarified searchTerms role in MVP vs. Epic 3 | Reviewer |
| 2026-02-05 | 0.3 | Implementation complete | Dev Agent |

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
Claude Opus 4.5 (Cursor IDE)

### Debug Log References
None - clean implementation.

### Completion Notes
- Created `src/queries.js` with 7 default GEO queries
- All queries have required fields: id, name, searchTerms, category
- JSDoc comments document the schema and MVP vs Epic 3 usage
- Updated `index.js` to import and display query count
- Verified import works: `node index.js` shows "Tracking 7 GEO queries"

### File List
| Action | File |
|--------|------|
| Created | `src/queries.js` |
| Modified | `index.js` (added queries import) |
